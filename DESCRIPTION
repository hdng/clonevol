Description: clonevol performs clonal ordering and visualization using
    the variant clustering results. It uses a bootstrap resampling
    technique to estimate the cellular prevalence of the clones within
    samples and probabilistically model clonal ordering constraints
    (sum and cross rules), hence it tolerates error and variability
    in cellular prevalence estimates of individual variants.
